HOW THE KINGDOM OF GOD AFFECTS YOU
 Note to the speaker:
Stimulate appreciation for the fact that those who are loyally supporting the Kingdom not only preach the good news of the Kingdom’s establishment but live their lives in harmony with the laws of that Kingdom
RULERSHIP BY GOD IS FAR FROM THE MINDS OF MOST PEOPLE (4 min.)
Most people are materialistic in outlook; think only in terms of what men can do (w71 99-100, 132; w79 7/1 17-18)
When told of God’s Kingdom, they usually have in mind something in another world
Mankind’s condition shows that we need help here on earth from higher Source; Bible points to that help (g85 7/22 3-8)
BIBLE DIRECTS ATTENTION TO GOD’S KINGDOM (10 min.)
Jesus taught followers to pray for God’s Kingdom, to seek it first (Mt 6:10, 33)
What is that Kingdom? It is a real government with rulers who exercise authority from heaven God’s purpose is that in time Kingdom will be the only government for all mankind (Re 5:10) Consistently, Jesus did not get involved in affairs of governments of his day (Lu 4:5-8; Joh 6:15)
He urged obedience to secular law but devoted self to preaching about Kingdom (Mt 4:17; 22:21) Jesus himself was the Messiah, anointed by God to be King (w82 2/1 21  ̊8)
John the Baptizer preached that the Kingdom had “drawn near” (Mt 3:2)
Because Jesus was among them, the Kingdom was ‘in their midst’ (Lu 17:21; it-2 167; g88 12/22 24; rs 226) In various ways Jesus demonstrated the scope of authority of Jehovah’s Messianic King
By God’s spirit, Jesus exercised control over wind and sea, vegetation, fish, and food supplies (Mr 4:39; 8:1-9; 11:20, 21)
Jesus also exercised power over human bodies—healing the blind, deaf, lame, diseased He raised the dead and expelled demons from those afflicted (Mt 12:28)
By his teaching and example, Jesus made clear the right way to live and worship (Jer 10:23; 1Pe 2:21)
What he taught was not theories of imperfect men but the word of God the Creator, who knows the purpose of our existence (Joh 8:28, 29)
Now raised from dead and exalted to heaven, he can handle all mankind’s affairs (Eph 1:19b-21) A government such as the Kingdom can really solve problems of mankind, and it will (rs 227-32)
WHEN THE KINGDOM BEGAN TO EXERCISE ITS POWER (10 min.)
Read Colossians 1:13. Does this refer to a future action or something that had already taken place? (w78 3/1
17-20; it-2 169)
At that time, the Son was ruling in his kingdom in heaven; true from Pentecost 33 C.E. onward
God’s Kingdom had not begun exercising its power over all mankind (rs 232) Over whom was Jesus ruling? According to Colossians 1:1, 2, the holy ones
Christ had indeed begun to rule but only over Christian congregation, not over mankind Christians’ adhering to his rule made them stand out as different from the world
A “little flock” was being taken out from mankind to share in heavenly Kingdom (Lu 12:32)
Establishment of Kingdom to rule over whole earth was yet future (1Co 4:8; Re 12:10, 12)
Daniel 7 describes succession of world powers down to 20th century, and then Daniel 7:13, 14 tells of conferring of authority at time of the end but before destruction spoken of in verse 26
The event described at Daniel 7:13, 14 took place in 1914 in heaven; it involves all peoples, national groups, and languages (w88 6/15 4-6)
This is the same event that is referred to in the proclamation at Revelation 11:15 (re 171) Now every one of us, all mankind, is directly touched by the activities of God’s Kingdom
HOW THE ACTIVITY OF GOD’S KINGDOM TOUCHES YOUR LIFE (16 min.)
Jesus foretold that after his receiving authority over all nations, he would finally separate people as a shepherd
separates sheep from goats (Mt 25:31-33)
Over what issue? Their treatment of his “brothers,” who preach God’s Kingdom (Mt 25:40, 45)
Christ purchased mankind; does not want to destroy them, but gives them opportunity to choose life
To what extent does Jesus go in offering opportunity to mankind? Greatest educational work in world is being carried on
About 70,000 schools in congregations worldwide train people to teach others about Kingdom; in over 200 lands Witnesses repeatedly go to homes to offer free instruction about Kingdom
Among the most widely distributed books in world are those (Bible, Truth book, and so forth) advocating that Kingdom (g88 2/8 11; g90 7/8 28)
No. 42-E 1/96 Printed in U.S.A.

This program of education has continued now for over 70 years; it has reached us, and that is why we are here today
Facts show that, though nations oppose preaching, Christ has been exercising overriding authority in “kingdom of mankind” since 1914 (Da 4:17)
The former Soviet Union tried to keep Witnesses out, but as a result of Russia’s own policies during World War II and after, they unwittingly took thousands of Witnesses into their land and provided free transport for them to areas that had never had a witness before
As a result, tens of thousands have taken stand for God’s Kingdom (g73 4/8 18; w86 2/1 13-14; g92 2/22 31) Witnesses were severely persecuted in Malawi, but when they fled, hundreds of favorably disposed persons
threw in their lot with them
Hundreds studying in refugee camps have been baptized
Illustrates how violent opposition, instead of stopping the work, lets individuals demonstrate with whom they side
How will the further action of God’s Kingdom affect your life? (Da 2:44)
Soon all false religion and political kingdoms of world and their supporters will be destroyed, along with all who persist in being liars, thieves, fornicators, adulterers, or homosexuals
People can change (1Co 6:11)
God’s Kingdom will make earth a paradise, heal mankind, raise the dead, educate in peace (rs 227-32)
Question is not merely whether we want to survive or we would like to live under fine conditions in new world
Rather, are we for God’s Kingdom or against it? Do we show in our daily lives that we really want God to rule over us?
SHOWING OUR APPRECIATION FOR GOD’S KINGDOM NOW (5 min.)
If we really want to live forever as subjects of Jehovah’s Messianic Kingdom, then we need to show it now
Are we vitally interested in God and his laws, a study of the Bible, association with Jehovah’s people? Do we apply God’s law in our lives, making needed changes to conform to his ways? (Mt 7:21)
Are we helping others to learn about God’s Kingdom? (Ac 20:25, 26; Re 22:17)
The objective of the Kingdom is to restore mankind to a fine relationship with God (1Co 15:24, 28) Appreciation for that Kingdom will move us to build and cherish such relationship now
